                 <h3>A new adventure tucked around every corner.</h3>
                 <p class="para-01">Between the energy of the dynamic urban cities, bustling of the famed night markets, colorful culture, fascinating history, incredibly friendly people, and dramatic landscape, you will be amazed at just how much awesome can be packed in this island.</p>
                 <p class="para-02">Taiwan is known by many names but perhaps the most memorable one is Formosa. This term was in fact coined by the Portuguese explorers in the 16th century. The full name, Ilha Formosa, directly translates to "Beautiful Island", and they sure got it right.</p>
                 <p class="para-03">Running down the countryâ€™s spine is the Central Mountain Range, a magnet for mountaineers looking to scale east Asia's tallest peak, Yushan or Jade Mountain. Taiwan's beaches are beautiful as well, offering some of east Asia's finest surfing and windsurfing spots.</p>

                <p class="para-01">The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture, attributable to the historical and ancestral origin of the majority of its current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and increasingly Western values.</p>
                <p class="para-01">Taiwan lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical. The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate. During the winter, the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern parts of island are mostly sunny. This prime location allows Taiwan to host some of the most breathtaking sceneries without needing to travel far.</p>
                <p class="para-03">Mandarin is the primary language in business and education. However about seventy percent of the population belong to the Hoklo ethnic group and speak Hokkien natively, in addition to Mandarin. Nowadays, most locals do speak English in the main cities, which allows for easier communication between foreigners and locals.</p>
