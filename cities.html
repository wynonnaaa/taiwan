                    <p>The perfect hosts, the people of Taipei are so eager to engage with their tourist visitors that it’s not uncommon for locals to strike up conversations with a complete stranger in the street. This is particularly true if said stranger is entangled in the accoutrements of a tourist and looks quite lost. Visit Taipei just once, and you’re guaranteed to make at least one local friend for life.</p>
                    <p>It matters not what neighborhood your hotel is in or how close it is to a night market, take a walk down a Taipei street, and within fifty paces you’ll find a street vendor selling something delicious on a stick. The street food in Taipei is beyond compare. Of course, many will point out that other cities in Taiwan are just as diverse in their streetside culinary delights, but in Taipei, there’s just so much to choose from.</p>
